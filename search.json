It includes information on the number of countries to which travelers in possession of each passport in the world may enter without going through the standard visa application process. The data is at the country level but also includes region groupings.\nDriving Question: How has passport power changed over time across regions?\nI began my analysis by creating a simple plot displaying the change in mean visa free count, meaning the number of countries that do not require the passport holder to apply for a visa beforehand, over time. Mean was used rather than sum so that the metric would not be skewed by the number of countries in a region.\n\nCoderegion_ranks &lt;- rank_by_year %&gt;%\n  group_by(region, year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(reg_free_count = mean(visa_free_count))\n\nggplot(region_ranks, aes(x = year, y = reg_free_count, color = region)) + \n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\") +\n  theme_classic() + \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Mean Visa Free Count\", title = \"Mean Visa Free Count by Region from 2006 to 2025\", color = \"Region\", caption = \"Cate Stacy, 9/16/25, Henley Passport Index\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graph displays an increase in the number of countries passport holders can visit without applying for a visa across all regions. In 2025, Europe had the highest mean visa free count and Africa had the lowest.\nNext, I explored a different measure of passport power, rank, which is highly correlated with visa free count, as seen in the scatterplot below. A lower rank indicates a more powerful passport.\n\nCoderank_by_year %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2025) %&gt;%\n  group_by(region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(reg_free_count = mean(visa_free_count), reg_rank = mean(rank)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reg_rank, y = reg_free_count)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Region Rank\", y = \"Region Free Count\", title = \"Region Free Count by Region Rank for 2025\", caption = \"Cate Stacy, 9/16/25, Henley Passport Index\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was specifically interesting in exploring how the mean rank changed from 2006 to 2025 across regions. I chose to visualize this as a spider plot. I first had to do some data wrangling in order to compute the difference in rank for each region and format the dataframe according to the specifications of radarchart().\n\nCoderank_change &lt;- rank_by_year %&gt;%\n  filter(year == \"2006\" | year == \"2025\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(region, year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_rank = mean(rank)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = mean_rank) %&gt;%\n  setNames(c(\"region\", \"yr_2006\", \"yr_2025\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(diff = yr_2025 - yr_2006) %&gt;%\n  select(region, diff) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = region, values_from = diff) \n  \nspider &lt;- rbind(rep(14,7), rep(-10, 7), rank_change)\nradarchart(\n  spider,\n  axistype = 1,\n  pcol = rgb(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.9), pfcol = rgb(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.5), plwd = 2,\n  cglcol = \"grey\", cglty = 1, axislabcol = \"black\",\n  cglwd = 0.8,\n  vlcex = 0.8,\n  seg = 6,\n  caxislabels = c(\"-10\", \"\", \"-2\", \"\", \"+6\", \"\", \"+14\"),\n)\n\ntitle(main = \"Mean Passport Rank Difference from 2006 to 2025 by Region\", sub = \"Cate Stacy, 9/16/25, Henley Passport Index\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the plot, Africa saw the greatest decline in passport power (~ +11) while the Caribbean saw the greatest increase in passport power (~ -8). This plot displays different patterns than the ones visualized in the line graph. While all regions saw an increase in visa free count from 2006 to 2005, not all regions experienced and increase in rank.",

    "text": "About the Data\nThe Tidy Tuesday data for the week of 9/2/25 comes from the sixth annual release of FrogID data. FrogID is a mobile app that enables citizen scientists in Australia to record and submit frog calls for experts to identify. Some key information provided in the dataset includes the time and location of the observation and taxonomic variables.\nDriving Question: How do the observed numbers of different types of frogs vary temporally and spatially?\nTemporal Analysis\nFirst, I was interested in exploring how the abundances of different types of frogs, specifically tribes, vary over the course of a day. Are some tribes more active at night? In the afternoon?\nTo investigate my question, I created a new variable for the time of day. I mutated the event time variable, which is recorded in seconds, and divided it into four categories. “Night” includes 12 AM to 6 AM, “Morning” includes 6 AM to 12 PM, “Afternoon” includes 12 PM to 6 PM, and “Evening” includes 6 PM to 12 AM.\n\nCode# Create variable for categorizing the time \nfrog &lt;- frog %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    time_of_day = case_when(\n      eventTime &gt;= 0 & eventTime &lt; 21600 ~ \"Night\",\n      eventTime &gt;= 21600 & eventTime &lt; 43200 ~ \"Morning\",\n      eventTime &gt;= 43200 & eventTime &lt; 64800 ~ \"Afternoon\",\n      eventTime &gt;= 64800 & eventTime &lt;= 86400 ~ \"Evening\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\nGiven that I am considering two categorical variables, time of day and tribe, I chose to visualize the data as a mosaic plot. The width of the columns is proportional to the number of observations at each time of day, and the vertical length of the bars is proportional to the number of observations for each tribe.\n\nCode# Remove entries where tribe is unknown\nfrog_plot &lt;- frog %&gt;%\n  select(time_of_day, tribe) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n\n# Create mosaic plot\nggplot(data = frog_plot %&gt;% mutate(tribe = as.factor(tribe))) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(time_of_day), fill = tribe)) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n  axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank(),\n  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) + \n  labs(title = \"Australian Frog Tribe Abundances at Different Times of Day\", \n  subtitle = \"2023 FrogID Data\", y = \"Tribe\", x = \"Time of Day\",\n  fill = \"Tribe\", caption = \"Cate Stacy, 9/7/25, TidyTuesday\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that frogs are more abundant in the mornings and evenings, which include dawn and dusk. However, it should be noted that this trend could also reflect the behavior patterns of citizen scientists. For example, it makes sense that there would be fewer people making observations at night between the hours of 12 AM and 6 AM. The Pelodryadidae, Myobatrachidae, and Limnodynastidae tribes are far more abundant than the Asterophryninae, Bufonidae, and Ranidae tribes across all times of day. The Myobatrachidae tribe appears to be relatively more active at afternoon and night than in evening and morning. The Bufonidae tribe appears to be most active in the morning.\nSpatial Analysis\nI was also curious if the abundances of different frog tribes varies by region. I chose to visualize the relationship between state province and tribe as a balloon plot. The size of the circles corresponds to the number of frogs of a specific tribe in a given province.\n\nCode# Create new data frame in proper format for balloon plot\nfrog_plot2 &lt;- frog %&gt;%\n  group_by(stateProvince, tribe) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n\n# Create balloon plot\nggballoonplot(frog_plot2, x = \"stateProvince\", y = \"tribe\",\n  size = \"Count\", fill = \"darkGreen\") + \n  labs(title = \"Australian Frog Tribe Abundances Across State Provinces\",\n  subtitle = \"2023 FrogID Data\", y = \"Tribe\", x = \"State Province\",\n  caption = \"Cate Stacy, 9/7/25, TidyTuesday\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot demonstrates that New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria had the most observations. However, it should be considered that there are potential confounding variables, including the size of the provinces and number of citizen scientists. This plot affirms the trend of Pelodryadidae, Myobatrachidae, and Limnodynastidae being most abundant, which was observed in the mosaic plot. An interesting finding is that the Ranidae tribe was only observed in Queensland. Additionally, despite having a relatively low total number of frogs, the Northern Territory had the second highest species richness (number of different species) and the highest species evenness (balanced relative abundance of different species).\nConclusions\nThrough creating visualizations, I was able to explore temporal and spatial variations in frog tribe abundance. More rigorous statistical analysis is required in order to make statements about the significance of the observed trends and account for potential confounding variables. However, the plots suggest that there are differences in frog activity among tribes and that the diversity and abundance of frogs varies across provinces.",

Using the class() function we can check the class (type) of object that we just read in. Note the presence of the “sf” and “data.frame” classes:\n\nCodeclass(nc)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_cities)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_water)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhen we read in spatial objects, it is useful to check what CRS underlies the data. We can do that with st_crs() from the sf package:\n\nCodest_crs(nc)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: NAD27 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"NAD27\",\n    DATUM[\"North American Datum 1927\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294.978698213898,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4267]]\n\n\nWe can treat sf objects similarly to ordinary datasets when using ggplot2 to make spatial visualizations:\n\nCodeggplot(nc) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    labs(title = \"NAD27\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange CRS\n\nLet’s explore how changing the CRS changes the map. The st_transform() function in sf re-expresses a spatial object using a user-supplied CRS. The crs argument takes a string descriptor of the CRS. We can find these descriptors via https://epsg.io.

Below we only plot large cities, and we color and size cities according to their population.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_b() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the scale_color_viridis_c() documentation via the ggplot2 reference.\n\nRead the function description at the top. What is the advantage of using this function for making color palettes?\nLook through the examples section. What is the difference between the _d(), _c(), and _b() variants of this function?\n\nThe viridis color scales provide maps that are uniform whether in color or black and white and is color-blind friendly.\nThe _d() variant is used when color is mapped to a discrete (categorical) variable. The _c() variant is used when color is mapped to a continuous variable. The _b() variant is used when color is mapped to a continuous variable but when we want that continuous variable to be binned so that there is a small set of colors.\nAdding Elevation Raster Data\nWhere are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the elevatr package. We encounter two new functions here—we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:\n\n\n?elevatr::get_elev_raster\n?terra::as.data.frame\n\n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nBuild on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.\n\nLook up the documentation for geom_raster() to plot the elevation data from elev_df. This will be the first layer of the plot.\nLook at the documentation for scale_fill_gradient() to add the following elevation color scale: \"darkgreen\" represents the lowest elevations, and \"white\" represents the highest elevations.\nAdd in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use fill = NA.\n\n\nCodeggplot() + geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + \n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom in to Twin Cities and Add Water\n\nThe bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let’s zoom in to this area.\n\n\nWe can use the st_bbox() function to get the bounding box for a spatial object—we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.\nWe then use st_crop() to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.\n\n\nCodeseven_countyarea &lt;- mn_counties |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% c(\"Anoka\", \"Hennepin\", \"Ramsey\", \"Dakota\", \"Carver\", \"Washington\", \"Scott\")) |&gt; \n    st_bbox()\nseven_countyarea\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n 419967.1 4924212.8  521254.8 5029157.4 \n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties |&gt; st_crop(seven_countyarea), z = 9, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nIn the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a coord_sf() layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called tc_map_zoom.png in the figures folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also jpeg() and pdf() functions for writing images.)\n\nCodepng(\"../figures/tc_map_zoom.png\", width = 800, height = 400)\nggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\ndev.off()",

    "text": "Exercise 2\nNavigate the Geoms section of the ggplot2 reference page to find a geom that corresponds to the visual elements in the temperature plot. Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodeggplot(weather) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(x=dateInYear, ymin = RecordLow, ymax = RecordHigh),  color = \"#ECEBE3\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows). Command+Shift+Return (Mac).\nRun current line/currently selected lines: Ctrl+Enter (Windows). Command+Return (Mac).",
